Throughout the second half of the term, you will work in groups of 3 on a project that answers a significant research question using real-world data, by implementing the fundamental techniques developed in our class, as well as some more advanced methods from supplementary sources. The project will culminate in a 20 minute presentation during the last week of class and a 10-15 page reproducible report.

More information about projects will be posted by Week 6 of the term.
